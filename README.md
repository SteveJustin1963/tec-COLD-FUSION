# tec-COLD-FUSION

TEC-1 apparatus for exploring hypothesized nuclear reaction at, or near, room temperature called cold fusion.

Cold fusion is a hypothetical type of nuclear reaction that would occur at, or near, room temperature. It is not yet clear how or if cold fusion reactions could occur, as they seem to contradict our current understanding of nuclear physics. Some scientists have claimed to have observed evidence of cold fusion, but these claims have not been reproducible.

Nuclear fusion reactions are those that occur when two nuclei join together to form a larger nucleus. These reactions release energy and can be used to power stars and create nuclear weapons.

In a nuclear fusion reaction, two or more atomic nuclei collide and fuse together to form a single, heavier nucleus. This process releases a large amount of energy, which can be used to generate electricity.

The most common fusion reaction is between two hydrogen atoms, which form a single helium atom. This reaction can be written as:

1H + 1H → 2He + energy

Other fusion reactions can involve different combinations of hydrogen atoms, as well as other elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.
calculate energy required to fuse two H atoms.
 

The energy required to fuse two hydrogen atoms is about 25 million electron volts (MeV). This is equivalent to about 4 × 10−12 joules, or about 0.00000000000004 joules.

Joules to watts calculation
The power P in watts (W) is equal to the energy E in joules (J), divided by the time period t in seconds (s):

P(W) = E(J) / t(s)

To generate 25 million electron volts is to use a particle accelerator, such as a synchrotron, to accelerate two hydrogen atoms to high speeds and then collide them head-on. The resulting fusion reaction will release energy that can be harnessed to generate electricity.

In order for two hydrogen atoms to fuse, they must be travelling at high speeds. The exact velocity required depends on the exact type of fusion reaction that is taking place. For the most common fusion reaction, the two hydrogen atoms must be travelling at about 10% the speed of light, or 30 million meters per second.

F=Bqv, where F is the force of the magnetic field, B is the magnetic field strength, q is the charge and v is the velocity. r=mVqB, where r is the radius of the magnetic field and V is the voltage. Rearranging these equations to solve for v, we get v=√2qΔVm

calculate the voltage required to move an electron at 10% the speed of light
- electron mass = 9.1093837 ×  10^-31 kilograms
- proton mass = 1.67262192 × 10^-27 kilograms
```
V = √2qΔV/m
V = √(2*1.60217662*10-19 * 0.1)/(9.10938356*10-31)
V = 2.6988297058*10E5 or 269,883 V or 300kV

```

am not sure if this correct, help!!!

### Electrostatic Confinement Fusion: 
"THE most interesting, tantalizing, and simplest fusion reactor to make is an inertial electrostatic confinement fusion reactor, or Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor. You can literally build them in a home lab and demonstrate fusion. Kids have shown them at science fairs (maybe with a bit of Dad’s help)."

"Basically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery."

"Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.

Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.

Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor: https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/46932494/759014-1.pdf

Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:

a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.

b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.

c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).

d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.

There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… aka Bussard's Polywell system. A company called EC3 was trying to continue his work, but no commercial success ever resulted, mostly due to a), c), and d) still limiting it. Maxwellian re-distribution of ion trajectories is the bane of much of plasma fusion physics, more so for ECF researchers."
