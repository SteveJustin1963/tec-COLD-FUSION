# tec-COLD-FUSION

TEC-1 apparatus for exploring hypothesized nuclear reaction at, or near, room temperature called cold fusion.

Cold fusion is a hypothetical type of nuclear reaction that would occur at, or near, room temperature. It is not yet clear how or if cold fusion reactions could occur, as they seem to contradict our current understanding of nuclear physics. Some scientists have claimed to have observed evidence of cold fusion, but these claims have not been reproducible.

Nuclear fusion reactions are those that occur when two nuclei join together to form a larger nucleus. These reactions release energy and can be used to power stars and create nuclear weapons.

In a nuclear fusion reaction, two or more atomic nuclei collide and fuse together to form a single, heavier nucleus. This process releases a large amount of energy, which can be used to generate electricity.

The most common fusion reaction is between two hydrogen atoms, which form a single helium atom. This reaction can be written as:

1H + 1H → 2He + energy

Other fusion reactions can involve different combinations of hydrogen atoms, as well as other elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.
calculate energy required to fuse two H atoms.
 

The energy required to fuse two hydrogen atoms is about 25 million electron volts (MeV). This is equivalent to about 4 × 10−12 joules, or about 0.00000000000004 joules.

Joules to watts calculation
The power P in watts (W) is equal to the energy E in joules (J), divided by the time period t in seconds (s):

P(W) = E(J) / t(s)
